The `read_file` function
=========================

Using the `with` statement
---------------------------

This is a test file for the `read_file` function, 
which reads a text file and prints its contents to the standard output (stdout).
The function uses the `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, 
even if an exception is raised.

First, import the `read_file` function from the `0-read_file` module:
    >>> read_file = __import__('0-read_file').read_file

Next, call the `read_file` function with the path to the text file:
    >>> read_file("my_file_0.txt")

Checking  the file is properly closed after reading:
    >>> f = open("my_file_0.txt", "r")
    >>> f.closed
    False
    >>> f.close()
    >>> f.closed
    True
