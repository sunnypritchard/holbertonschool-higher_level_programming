The `write_file` function
=========================

Using the `with` statement
---------------------------

This is a test file for the `write_file` function, 
which writes a string to a text file and returns the number of characters written.
The function uses the `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, 
even if an exception is raised.

First, import the `write_file` function from the `1-write_file` module:
    >>> write_file = __import__('1-write_file').write_file

Call the `write_file` function with the path to the text file and the string to write:
    >>> nb_char = write_file("my_first_file.txt", "A school every software engineer would have dreamt of!")
    >>> nb_char
    54

Check the content of the file to ensure it was written correctly:
    >>> print(open("my_first_file.txt").read())
    A school every software engineer would have dreamt of!
