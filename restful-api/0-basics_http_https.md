# HTTP & HTTPS Protocol

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure), including their differences, structure, methods, and status codes.


## HTTP vs HTTPS

### Key Differences

| Feature | HTTP | HTTPS |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Security** | Unencrypted data transmission | Encrypted data transmission using SSL/TLS |
| **Port** | Default port 80 | Default port 443 |
| **SSL Certificate** | Not required | Required |
| **Data Integrity** | Vulnerable to tampering | Protected against tampering |
| **Privacy** | Data visible to intermediaries | Data encrypted end-to-end |
| **SEO Ranking** | Lower priority | Preferred by search engines |
| **Browser Indication** | No security indicator or "Not Secure" warning | Padlock icon in address bar |

### When to Use HTTPS

HTTPS should be used for:
- Any website handling sensitive information (passwords, credit cards, personal data)
- E-commerce platforms
- Login pages
- Banking and financial services
- Any site where user privacy and trust are important
- Modern web applications (increasingly the standard)



## HTTP Request Structure

An HTTP request consists of the following components:

```
[METHOD] [PATH] [HTTP VERSION]
[HEADERS]

[BODY]
```

### Example HTTP Request

```http
GET /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
Connection: keep-alive
```

### Request Components

1. **Request Line**
   - **Method**: The HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
   - **Path**: The resource path or endpoint
   - **HTTP Version**: Usually HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2

2. **Headers**
   - Metadata about the request
   - Common headers: Host, User-Agent, Accept, Content-Type, Authorization

3. **Body** (optional)
   - Contains data being sent to the server
   - Typically used with POST, PUT, PATCH methods


## HTTP Response Structure

An HTTP response consists of the following components:

```
[HTTP VERSION] [STATUS CODE] [STATUS MESSAGE]
[HEADERS]

[BODY]
```

### Example HTTP Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 08 Oct 2025 10:30:00 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 145
Server: nginx/1.18.0

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T08:30:00Z"
}
```

### Response Components

1. **Status Line**
   - **HTTP Version**: The protocol version
   - **Status Code**: Three-digit code indicating the result
   - **Status Message**: Human-readable description

2. **Headers**
   - Metadata about the response
   - Common headers: Content-Type, Content-Length, Server, Cache-Control

3. **Body** (optional)
   - Contains the actual data being returned
   - Can be HTML, JSON, XML, binary data, etc.



## HTTP Methods

HTTP methods define the type of action to be performed on a resource.

### Common HTTP Methods

| Method | Description | Use Case | Idempotent | Safe |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|------|
| **GET** | Retrieves data from the server | Fetching a web page, retrieving user information from an API, loading images | Yes | Yes |
| **POST** | Submits data to create a new resource | Submitting a form, creating a new user account, uploading a file | No | No |
| **PUT** | Updates or replaces an entire resource | Updating a user profile completely, replacing a document | Yes | No |
| **PATCH** | Partially updates a resource | Changing a user's email address, updating specific fields | No | No |
| **DELETE** | Removes a resource from the server | Deleting a user account, removing a blog post | Yes | No |
| **HEAD** | Retrieves headers only (no body) | Checking if a resource exists, verifying file metadata | Yes | Yes |
| **OPTIONS** | Describes communication options | CORS preflight requests, discovering allowed methods | Yes | Yes |
| **CONNECT** | Establishes a tunnel to the server | Creating a tunnel for SSL/TLS through a proxy | No | No |
| **TRACE** | Performs a message loop-back test | Debugging, diagnostic purposes (rarely used) | Yes | Yes |

### Detailed Method Descriptions

#### GET
- **Purpose**: Request data from a specified resource
- **Example**: `GET /api/products?category=electronics`
- **Characteristics**: Should not modify server state, can be cached, can be bookmarked

#### POST
- **Purpose**: Send data to create a new resource
- **Example**: Creating a new blog post
```http
POST /api/posts HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "My New Post",
  "content": "This is the content..."
}
```

#### PUT
- **Purpose**: Update or replace an entire resource
- **Example**: Replacing all user information
```http
PUT /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "age": 30
}
```

#### PATCH
- **Purpose**: Apply partial modifications to a resource
- **Example**: Updating only the email field
```http
PATCH /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```

#### DELETE
- **Purpose**: Remove a specified resource
- **Example**: `DELETE /api/users/123`
- **Characteristics**: Removes the resource, subsequent requests to the same resource should return 404


## HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request. They are grouped into five categories.

### 1xx Informational

| Code | Status | Description | Scenario |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **100** | Continue | The initial part of the request has been received and the client should continue | Server tells client to proceed with sending the request body |
| **101** | Switching Protocols | The server is switching protocols as requested by the client | Upgrading from HTTP to WebSocket |
| **102** | Processing | The server has received and is processing the request (WebDAV) | Long-running request is being processed |

### 2xx Success

| Code | Status | Description | Scenario |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **200** | OK | The request succeeded | Successfully retrieved data, page loaded successfully |
| **201** | Created | A new resource has been successfully created | User account created, new blog post published |
| **202** | Accepted | Request accepted for processing, but not completed | Background job queued, async operation initiated |
| **204** | No Content | Request succeeded but no content to return | Successful DELETE operation, updating without returning data |
| **206** | Partial Content | Partial resource is being delivered | Video streaming, resumable file downloads |

### 3xx Redirection

| Code | Status | Description | Scenario |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **301** | Moved Permanently | Resource has been permanently moved to a new URL | Website domain changed, page permanently relocated |
| **302** | Found | Resource temporarily located at a different URL | Temporary redirect during maintenance |
| **304** | Not Modified | Resource hasn't changed since last request | Browser cache is still valid, no need to re-download |
| **307** | Temporary Redirect | Temporary redirect preserving the request method | Similar to 302 but method must remain the same |
| **308** | Permanent Redirect | Permanent redirect preserving the request method | Similar to 301 but method must remain the same |

### 4xx Client Errors

| Code | Status | Description | Scenario |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **400** | Bad Request | The server cannot process the request due to client error | Malformed JSON, missing required fields, invalid syntax |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Authentication is required and has failed or not been provided | Accessing protected resource without login credentials |
| **403** | Forbidden | Server understood the request but refuses to authorize it | User doesn't have permission to access the resource |
| **404** | Not Found | The requested resource could not be found | Page doesn't exist, API endpoint is incorrect, deleted resource |
| **405** | Method Not Allowed | The HTTP method is not supported for this resource | Using POST on a read-only endpoint |
| **408** | Request Timeout | The server timed out waiting for the request | Slow network connection, client took too long to send data |
| **409** | Conflict | Request conflicts with the current state of the server | Trying to create a resource that already exists |
| **410** | Gone | Resource is permanently unavailable | Deleted page that won't come back |
| **413** | Payload Too Large | Request entity is larger than server limits | Uploading a file that exceeds size limits |
| **415** | Unsupported Media Type | The server doesn't support the media format | Sending XML when only JSON is accepted |
| **422** | Unprocessable Entity | Request is well-formed but contains semantic errors | Validation errors, business logic violations |
| **429** | Too Many Requests | The user has sent too many requests in a given time | Rate limiting, API quota exceeded |

### 5xx Server Errors

| Code | Status | Description | Scenario |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **500** | Internal Server Error | A generic error occurred on the server | Unhandled exception, programming error, server crash |
| **501** | Not Implemented | Server doesn't support the functionality required | Unsupported HTTP method or feature |
| **502** | Bad Gateway | Server received an invalid response from upstream server | Proxy or gateway error, backend server is down |
| **503** | Service Unavailable | Server is temporarily unable to handle the request | Server maintenance, overloaded server, temporary outage |
| **504** | Gateway Timeout | Server didn't receive a timely response from upstream server | Backend server is too slow, timeout connecting to database |
| **505** | HTTP Version Not Supported | Server doesn't support the HTTP version used in the request | Client using HTTP/3 but server only supports HTTP/1.1 |


## Common Header Fields

### Request Headers

- **Location**: URL to redirect to (with 3xx status codes)
- **Server**: Information about the server software
- **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**: CORS policy


## Best Practices

### For API Development

1. **Use appropriate HTTP methods**: GET for reading, POST for creating, PUT/PATCH for updating, DELETE for removing
2. **Return meaningful status codes**: Help clients understand what happened
3. **Use HTTPS**: Always encrypt sensitive data in transit
4. **Implement proper error handling**: Return clear error messages with appropriate status codes
5. **Version your API**: Use versioning to maintain backward compatibility
6. **Rate limiting**: Protect your API with 429 responses
7. **Use proper headers**: Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, etc.

### For Web Development

1. **Migrate to HTTPS**: It's no longer optional for modern websites
2. **Handle errors gracefully**: Provide user-friendly error pages for 404, 500, etc.
3. **Implement caching**: Use 304 responses and cache headers effectively
4. **Use redirects properly**: 301 for permanent, 302/307 for temporary
5. **Validate input**: Return 400 for bad requests before processing
6. **Secure authentication**: Use proper 401/403 responses and secure tokens
